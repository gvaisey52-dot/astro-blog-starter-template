        <h1>Warning to Rochester Homeowners About Shane P. Alcott d/b/a Alcott Construction</h1>
        <strong>Shane P. Alcott d/b/a Alcott Construction or Shane's Drywall (Culver Rd, Rochester)</strong>, so others can avoid similar issues.</p>
        <p>In June 2025, I hired Mr. Alcott through Angie’s List to build a backyard patio. We agreed that I would supply the materials, and he would provide labor. He showed up twice for only a few hours each time, damaged parts of my yard, and never completed the work. He also failed to properly install a drain he recommended. After the second visit, he stopped responding to calls and texts.</p>
        <p>I took him to <strong>Irondequoit Small Claims Court</strong> (Docket #2507222) and in October 2025 I won a judgment of <strong>$1,065 (Deposit + Court Costs)</strong>. He admitted to the judge that he didn’t want his name to be associated with the project — but never communicated that to me before disappearing. He had no problem cashing my deposit check of <strong>$1,050</strong>. He claimed that I purchased the wrong material (which he signed off on in the contract) and when the judge asked him if he said anything he said, “nope just ignored him”.</p>
        <p>He willfully defrauded me and now I’m stuck with a backyard that is destroyed and some material I cannot use. He ruined a family project.</p>
        <p>Since the judgment in my favor, he has avoided my efforts to collect the judgment, avoided being served his Information Subpoena to disclose assets and based on some public record sleuthing has owned multiple businesses under various names and has had a Tax Warrant issued for incoming taxes owed. Additionally, I have since found other people via Google Maps and Angie’s List with similar complaints. I’ve logged negative reviews on both platforms and filed complaints with Angie’s List since that is where I found him originally.</p>
        <p>People that know him have reached out to me directly with stories of helping him and never getting paid and public records searches on the Monroe County Clerk site shows NYS Tax Warrants for unpaid taxes.</p>
		<p><strong>Please share this information</strong> with your networks and be cautious when hiring Alcott Construction or Shane P. Alcott. In my experience, he did not honor his commitments.</p>
